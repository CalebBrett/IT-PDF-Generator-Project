# IT-PDF-Generator-Project
This was a program I made for my Information Technology class in 2017.

The project was to find a client with a problem and solve it using technology. My client was a teacher at my school who was in charge of service activities. He wanted a way for students to fill out application forms for the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization without needing to print them all out and have students handwrite them. So I made this program using Java's awt and swing GUI tools to make a menu where you can type in your information and when you are finished you can generate a PDF file which uses the blank form as a template and fills the information you entered into the correct places on the form. These PDF's could then be printed or emailed to this teacher who could easily organize and store these application forms.
